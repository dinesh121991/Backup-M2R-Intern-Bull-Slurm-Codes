.SH "NAME"
burst_buffer.conf \- Slurm configuration file for burst buffer management.

.SH "DESCRIPTION"
\fBburst_buffer.conf\fP is an ASCII file which describes the configuration
of burst buffer resource management.
This file is only required on the head node(s), where the slurmctld daemon
executes.
The file location can be modified at system build time using the
DEFAULT_SLURM_CONF parameter or at execution time by setting the SLURM_CONF
environment variable.
The file will always be located in the same directory as the \fBslurm.conf\fP
file.
In order to support multiple configuration files for mutliple burst buffer
plugins, the configuration file may alternately be given a name containing
the plugin name.
For example, if "burst_buffer.conf" is not found, the burst_buffer/generic
configuration could be read from a file named "burst_buffer_generic.conf".
.LP
Parameter names are case insensitive.
Any text following a "#" in the configuration file is treated
as a comment through the end of that line.
Changes to the configuration file take effect upon restart of
Slurm daemons, daemon receipt of the SIGHUP signal, or execution
of the command "scontrol reconfigure".
.LP
The configuration parameters available include:

.TP
\fBAllowUsers\fR
Colon delimited list of user names and/or IDs permitted to use burst buffers.
The options \fBAllowUsers\fR and \fBDenyUsers\fR can not both be specified.
By default all users are permitted to use burst buffers.
 
.TP
\fBDenyUsers\fR
Colon delimited list of user names and/or IDs prevented from using burst buffers.
The options \fBAllowUsers\fR and \fBDenyUsers\fR can not both be specified.
By default all users are permitted to use burst buffers.

.TP
\fBGetSysState\fR
Fully qualified path name of a program which will return the current burst
buffer state.
This should be the path of the \fIbbs_pools\fR command for the Cray plugin.
Other Cray burst buffer commands are assumed to be in the same directory
as the bbs_pools command.
See the src/plugins/burst_buffer/generic/bb_get_state.example in the
Slurm distribution for an example.

.TP
\fBGranularity\fR
Granularity of job space allocations in units of gigabytes.
The default value is 1 gigabyte.

.\ Possible future enhancement
.\ .TP
.\ \fBGres\fR
.\ Generic resources associated with burst buffers.
.\ This is a completely separate name space from the Gres defined in the slurm.conf
.\ file.
.\ The Gres value consistes of a comma separated list of generic resources,
.\ each of which includes a name separated by a colon and a numeric value.
.\ The numeric value can include a suffic of "k", "m" or "g", which multiplies
.\ the numeric value by 1,024, 1,048,576, or 1,073,741,824 respectively.
.\ The numeric value is a 32-bit value.
.\ See the example below.

.TP
\fBJobSizeLimit\fR
Maximum burst buffer allocation size for any single job.
The numeric value may have a suffix of "m" (megabytes), "g" (gigabytes),
"t" (terabytes), "p" (petabytes), or "n" (nodes).
Gigabytes is assumed if no suffix is supplied.
By default there is no job allocation size limit.

.TP
\fBPrioBoostUse\fR
Any job using burst buffers will have it's priority increased by this amount.
This option will adjust a job's nice value, so user specified nice values
for a job will be replaced by this value.

.TP
\fBPrioBoostAlloc\fR
Any job using burst buffers will have it's priority increased by this amount
after its file stage in has completed.
This option will adjust a job's nice value, so user specified nice values
for a job will be replaced by this value.
he \fBPrioBoostAlloc\fR value will override the \fBPrioBoostUse\fR value.

.TP
\fBPrivateData\fR
If set to "true" then users will only be able to view burst buffers they can
use.
Slurm administrators will still be able to view all burst buffers.
By default, users can view all burst buffers.

.TP
\fBStageInTimeout\fR
If the stage in of files for a job takes more than this number of seconds,
the burst buffer will be released and the job will be placed in a held state.
A Slurm administrator will be required to release the job.
By default there is no timeout of the stage in process.

.TP
\fBStageOutTimeout\fR
If the stage out of files for a job takes more than this number of seconds,
the burst buffer will be released and the job will be purged.
By default there is no timeout of the stage out process.

.TP
\fBStartStageIn\fR
Fully qualified path name of a program which will stage files in for a job.
This option is used by the generic plugin and ignored by the cray plugin.
See the src/plugins/burst_buffer/generic/bb_start_stage_in.example in the
Slurm distribution for an example.

.TP
\fBStartStageOut\fR
Fully qualified path name of a program which will stage files out for a job.
This option is used by the generic plugin and ignored by the cray plugin.
See the src/plugins/burst_buffer/generic/bb_start_stage_out.example in the
Slurm distribution for an example.

.TP
\fBStopStageIn\fR
Fully qualified path name of a program which will stop staging files in for a job.
This option is used by the generic plugin and ignored by the cray plugin.
See the src/plugins/burst_buffer/generic/bb_stop_stage_out.example in the
Slurm distribution for an example.

.TP
\fBStopStageOut\fR
Fully qualified path name of a program which will stop staging files in for a job.
This option is used by the generic plugin and ignored by the cray plugin.
See the src/plugins/burst_buffer/generic/bb_stop_stage_out.example in the
Slurm distribution for an example.

.TP
\fBUserSizeLimit\fR
Maximum burst buffer allocation size for any single user.
The size is calculated by adding the burst buffer allocations for all jobs
plus any persistent buffers belonging to the user.
The numeric value may have a suffix of "m" (megabytes), "g" (gigabytes),
"t" (terabytes), "p" (petabytes), or "n" (nodes).
Gigabytes is assumed if no suffix is supplied.
By default there is no job allocation size limit.
